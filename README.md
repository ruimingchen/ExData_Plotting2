# Exploratory Data Analysis: Plotting2

## Question #1: 
### Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
### Answer: plot1.png showed that total emissions from PM2.5 have decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008.

## Question #2: 
### Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
### Answer: plot2.png showed that total emissions from PM2.5 have decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008. However there was an increase of PM2.5 between the year 2002 and 2006.

## Question #3:
### Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
### Answer: plot3.png showed that three of the four types of sources have seen decrease in emission from from 1999 to 2008, they are NON-ROAD, NONPOINT and ON-ROAD. Only POINT source has seen increases.

## Question #4:
### Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?
### Answer: plot4.png showed that emissions from coal combustion-related sources has seen decreases from 1999 to 2008 across the United States.

## Question #5:
### How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999 to 2008 in Baltimore City? 
### Answer: plot5.png showed that emissions from motor vehicle sources has seen increases from 1999 to 2002 in Baltimore City, it slightly decrased from 2002 to 2005, and dramtically decreased from 2005 to 2008.

## Question #6:
### Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
### Answer: plot6.png showed that from 1999 to 2002 emissions from Baltimore City and Los Angeles City both increased; from 2002 to 2005 emissions from Baltimore City continue increasing, while emission from Los Angeles County descreased slightly. From 2005 to 2008, emissions from Baltimore City slightly decreased while emissions from Los Angeles County significantly decreased, in 2008 it has come down to its level of 1999.
